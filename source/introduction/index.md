# Introduction

Do you always save your things? If the answer is sure. The *All Thing about Desbros (ATD)* is a good sample. And if the answer isn't true, I remember also you look this.

The ATD includes a lot of text about Desbros, myself and it also includes my knowledges. And a lot of others. It becomes a large document.

The ATD is also my dream I wanted to write it down long ago. Now, It becomes true. I'm happy and I'll do it serious.
