# Introduction

Do you always save your things? If the answer is sure. The *All Thing about Desbros (ATD)* is a good sample. And if the answer isn't true, I remember also you look this.

In my opinions, Future, the ATD includes a lot of text about Desbros, myself and it also includes my knowledges. And a lot of others. It becomes a large document.

**These documents are about me and my knowledges and related stuffs**. You can also understand me from this.
