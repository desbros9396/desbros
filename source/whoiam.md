# Who I Am?

## My name
I'm Desbros. I was born in China, so I have also a Chinese name, that's Xinghao.

Desbros is easy to pronunce, but Xinghao usually hard to pronunce for non-Chinese-native speakers. I remember you to listen how to pronunce 星昊[^1]. It's like a native-speakers to say it. (at first, I want to introduce detailly how to pronunce it. But in a text, it's hard to do. Because if you didn't listen or learn Chinese. You are hard to understand it.)

  [^1]:
    Xinghao is its Chinese *pinyin* without tones.

## My experience

I'm a student now.
