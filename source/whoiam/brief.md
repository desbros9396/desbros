# Brief

## Name

**That's my name development history in the Internet accounts.**

I was born in China, so I had a Chinese name. It's Xinghao.

1. When I grow up, I active in the Internet. I make software accounts by follow one's own inclinations. It may follow the popular activities in the short videos software. such as *Kailangde Wangyou*[^kailangdewangyou]. 

2. Once, I understand how do a foreigner naming his(or her) account. He(or she) use his(or her) name add a number in naming. I think it's good. So I started naming accounts by that.

3. Later, I gave my self an English name. "Desbros". By the way, the desbros name is arbitrary choice a place name, In raw, It's Desbrosses. But I think *sses* is unnecessary. So I just reserve *s*. Not mean that Desbros Group. And I think it's easy to pronunce.
